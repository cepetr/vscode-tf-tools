# Glossary

This glossary defines the preferred product and documentation terms used by the extension specifications.

## Product And Workspace Terms

| Term | Definition | Preferred Usage / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Trezor Firmware Tools** | The formal product name of the extension. | Use in the title, introduction, and places where the official product name matters. |
| **Trezor** | The compact user-facing label used in space-constrained UI surfaces. | Use for the activity bar container title, command category prefix, and other compact UI labels. Do not use it as a replacement for the formal product name in general prose. |
| **the extension** | The default prose reference to Trezor Firmware Tools after first mention. | Preferred term for most requirement and behavior statements throughout the specification. |
| **tf-tools** | Short internal identifier for the product. | Use for file names, setting prefixes, variable names, command ids, and compact references. Do not use as the main product name in user-facing prose. |
| **workspace** | The single opened VS Code workspace folder in which the extension operates. | The product assumes a single-root workspace. |
| **workspace root** | The root directory of the opened workspace folder. | Use when describing how relative settings or manifest paths are resolved. |
| **workspace maintainer** | A person who authors or updates the manifest, templates, and workspace-specific settings consumed by the extension. | Useful when requirements address repository configuration rather than day-to-day usage. |
| **user** | A person operating the extension inside VS Code. | Default actor for product behavior unless a narrower role is needed. |

## Configuration Terms

| Term | Definition | Preferred Usage / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **active build context** | The currently selected combination of model, target, and component that drives visible UI state and runtime behaviors. | Preferred product term when behavior depends on the current selection. |
| **active configuration** | The persisted workspace-state record that stores the selected model id, target id, component id, and save timestamp. | Use for persistence and normalization behavior; avoid using it as a synonym for any visible UI section. |
| **Configuration view** | The tree view contributed by the extension inside the `Trezor` activity bar container. | Preferred term for the extension's main side-bar surface. |
| **Build Selection** | The Configuration view section that shows the current model, target, and component selectors. | Use this exact capitalization for the UI surface. |
| **model** | A manifest-defined firmware family or device line available for selection. | User-facing labels come from `model.name`; rules and persistence use `model.id`. |
| **target** | A manifest-defined build target available for selection, such as a hardware or emulator variant. | User-facing labels prefer `target.shortName` when present, otherwise `target.name`. |
| **component** | A manifest-defined buildable firmware component available for selection. | User-facing labels come from `component.name`; rules and persistence use `component.id`. |
| **target display name** | The label shown for the selected target in the UI and task labels. | Defined as `target.shortName` when present, otherwise `target.name`. |
| **selection normalization** | The process of restoring or correcting saved selections so they always resolve to valid manifest entries. | Use when describing startup recovery and manifest-change handling. |

## Manifest Terms

| Term | Definition | Preferred Usage / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **manifest** | The YAML file that defines available models, targets, components, build options, debug profiles, and related rules. | This is the runtime source of truth for product behavior. |
| **manifest path** | The workspace setting that points to the manifest file. | Exposed as `tfTools.manifestPath`. |
| **tf-tools manifest** | Shorthand for the manifest file used by Trezor Firmware Tools. | Acceptable short form when the file itself is the subject. |
| **manifest status** | The current load state of the manifest: `loaded`, `missing`, or `invalid`. | Use when describing command gating and warning surfaces. |
| **validation issue** | A concrete manifest problem found during parsing or validation. | Use for structured problems that may become diagnostics or logs. |
| **when expression** | A manifest-defined availability rule composed from `model(...)`, `target(...)`, `component(...)`, `all(...)`, `any(...)`, and `not(...)`. | Use this term consistently for option and debug availability rules. Avoid looser names like "condition string". |

## Build Option Terms

| Term | Definition | Preferred Usage / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Build Options** | The Configuration view section that shows manifest-driven build options. | Use this exact capitalization for the UI surface. |
| **build option** | A manifest-defined option that can affect build behavior and command arguments. | Generic term covering both checkbox and multistate forms. |
| **checkbox option** | A build option that is either enabled or disabled. | Preferred term over "boolean option" in user-facing prose. |
| **multistate option** | A build option that exposes one selected state from a fixed list. | Preferred term over "enum option" in user-facing prose. |
| **option state** | One selectable value inside a multistate option. | Use when describing state labels, defaults, and persistence. |
| **default state** | The option state used when no explicit user selection is stored. | Applies to multistate options. |
| **option availability** | Whether a build option is currently visible and effective for the active build context. | Driven by a `when` expression when one is defined. |
| **option group** | A named visual grouping of build options in the tree view. | Use only for UI organization; it is not a separate configuration entity. |

## Artifact And Task Terms

| Term | Definition | Preferred Usage / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Build Artifacts** | The Configuration view section that reports artifact status and exposes artifact-related actions. | Use this exact capitalization for the UI surface. |
| **artifacts root** | The directory configured by `tfTools.artifactsPath` that contains model-specific artifact folders. | Preferred term over generic phrases like "artifacts directory" when precision matters. |
| **artifact folder** | The model-defined subfolder under the artifacts root where that model's derived files are expected. | Comes from `model.artifactFolder`. |
| **artifact basename** | The shared base filename stem formed from `component.artifactName` plus `target.artifactSuffix`. | Useful when describing compile commands, binary, and map file derivation. |
| **compile commands artifact** | The `.cc.json` file that represents the expected compile database for the active build context. | Preferred product term over raw filename references when discussing IntelliSense. |
| **binary artifact** | The `.bin` file expected for the active build context when flash or upload is applicable. | Use for row state and action enablement. |
| **map file artifact** | The `.map` file expected for the active build context when binary-related actions are applicable. | Use for row state and the open-map action. |
| **executable artifact** | The executable file derived for debug launch from artifact name, suffix, and executable extension. | Preferred term when discussing debug readiness. |
| **artifact status** | The user-facing presence state of an artifact row: `valid` or `missing`. | Use for tree row descriptions, not for low-level file existence checks. |
| **xtask** | The workspace's Cargo-based task runner used by the extension to launch build-related firmware workflows. | Use this term when referring to the command backend that receives model, target, component, and build-option arguments. |
| **Build** | The primary command and task that runs the active firmware build workflow. | Capitalize when referring to the named command. |
| **Clippy** | The command and task that runs lint-oriented firmware checks for the active build context. | Capitalize as the task/command name. |
| **Check** | The command and task that runs non-building validation for the active build context. | Capitalize as the task/command name. |
| **Clean** | The command and task that clears build outputs without using active-build-context-derived arguments. | Capitalize as the task/command name. |
| **Flash to Device** | The user-facing command or row action that writes the active binary artifact to a device when applicable. | Use this exact capitalization when referring to the UI action. `Flash` is acceptable only as a shorter secondary reference after the full name is established. |
| **Upload to Device** | The user-facing command or row action that uploads the active binary artifact when applicable. | Use this exact capitalization when referring to the UI action. `Upload` is acceptable only as a shorter secondary reference after the full name is established. |

## IntelliSense And File-Visibility Terms

| Term | Definition | Preferred Usage / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IntelliSense** | The editor assistance aligned to the active compile database and delivered through the configured C/C++ provider. | Keep the VS Code spelling and capitalization. |
| **compile database** | The parsed compile-commands data used to derive per-file C/C++ configuration. | Product-facing equivalent of the compile commands artifact contents. |
| **configuration provider** | The C/C++ IntelliSense provider that tf-tools integrates with. | In this product, this means the cpptools custom configuration provider contract. |
| **provider readiness** | Whether the required C/C++ provider is installed and configured for tf-tools. | Use when describing prerequisite warnings. |
| **excluded file** | A file that falls within excluded-file scope but is not included in the active compile database. | Preferred user-facing term for the feature. |
| **excluded-file scope** | The combination of configured filename patterns and folder globs that limits where excluded-file marking applies. | Prefer this term over "rules" when describing the overall scope behavior. |
| **Explorer badge** | The exclusion marker shown in the VS Code Explorer for excluded files. | Use for the explorer surface specifically. |
| **editor overlay** | The first-line warning shown inside editors for excluded files when enabled. | Use for the editor surface specifically. |

## Debug Terms

| Term | Definition | Preferred Usage / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Start Debugging** | The user-facing command and inline action that starts a debug session for the active build context. | Use this exact capitalization for the UI action. |
| **debug profile** | One manifest-defined debug entry owned by a component and evaluated against the active build context. | Preferred term over "debug config" because the final launch configuration is derived, not stored directly in the manifest. |
| **debug profile resolution** | The process of evaluating the selected component's debug profiles in declaration order and choosing the first matching one. | Use when describing debug availability and launch preparation. |
| **debug template** | The JSONC file referenced by a debug profile and loaded at launch time. | Preferred term over "launch template" in this product. |
| **debug templates path** | The workspace setting that points to the directory containing debug templates. | Exposed as `tfTools.debug.templatesPath`. |
| **debug variable** | A tf-tools substitution variable available during template resolution. | Covers built-in variables and profile-defined `tfTools.debug.var:<name>` entries. |
| **built-in debug variable** | A substitution variable derived from the active model, target, component, artifact path, executable, or debug profile name. | Use when distinguishing built-ins from profile-defined variables. |
| **profile-defined debug variable** | A substitution variable declared in a manifest debug profile under `vars`. | Use this term instead of just "custom variable" for precision. |
| **substitution token** | A `${...}` placeholder found in a debug template before tf-tools substitution runs. | Use when describing template inputs rather than resolved values. |
| **declaration order** | The order in which debug profiles appear in the manifest. | Important because the first matching debug profile wins. |
| **debug resolution failure** | A launch-blocking failure that occurs while selecting a matching debug profile, loading its template, or resolving tf-tools debug variables. | Use for failures before VS Code starts the debug session. |

## Availability Terms

| Term | Definition | Preferred Usage / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **available action** | A command or row action that is currently shown and can be executed. | Use when all prerequisites for the current surface are satisfied. |
| **disabled action** | A command or row action that remains visible to indicate capability, but cannot currently be executed because a prerequisite is missing. | Use for discoverable-but-not-runnable states such as missing artifacts. |
| **blocked command** | A command whose execution is rejected after invocation because the current workspace or manifest state does not allow it. | Use when the extension reports a failure instead of starting the action. |
| **hidden action** | A command or row action omitted from a surface because it does not apply to the current build context or surface. | Use when the action should not be presented at all. |
| **action enablement state** | The combined visible/runnable state of a command or row action on a particular surface. | Useful when specifying hidden versus disabled versus blocked behavior. |

## Settings And Observability Terms

| Term | Definition | Preferred Usage / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **resource-scoped setting** | A VS Code setting that can vary by workspace rather than being globally fixed. | Use when describing tf-tools configuration settings. |
| **command surface** | A user-facing place where a command is exposed, such as the Command Palette, a view header, an overflow menu, or an inline row action. | Use when describing shared command availability and visibility rules across multiple entry points. |
| **invalid when expression** | A manifest `when`, `flashWhen`, or `uploadWhen` expression that cannot be parsed, validated, or resolved against known ids. | Use for manifest validation failures rather than runtime false results. |
| **status bar configuration item** | The status bar entry that shows the active build context and opens the Configuration view. | Preferred product phrase over generic "status bar text". |
| **diagnostic** | A persistent file-backed problem shown through the Problems view and relevant editors. | Use for manifest-backed validation issues. |
| **log output** | The dedicated `Trezor Firmware Tools` output channel that records runtime warnings, errors, and detail. | Preferred term over generic "logs" when the VS Code output channel is meant. |
| **user-visible error** | An error surfaced directly in the UI, typically as a VS Code notification or disabled action state. | Use when distinguishing transient UX feedback from persistent diagnostics or logs. |
